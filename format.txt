COMMENTS:

  isogeny_number - This number is the longest degree of a chain of isogenies
                   between non-isomorphic curves.   For example, a 12 means
                   the isogeny class contains a curve which possesses 
                   a 12-isogeny.

  modular_degree - The modular degree of the optimal quotient of J_0(N).
                   The star means that the curve of minimal Faltings height is not
                   J0-optimal. The plus indicates that the minimal Faltings height curve
                   is a minimal quadratic twist.

  torsion_subgroup - n or nx, where n means Z/nZ and nx means Z/nZ x Z/2Z (only used when n even).

  ord(Delta) - Surrounded in square or round brackets:
                   * square means that Delta is positive and 
                   * round brackets mean that Delta is negative.
               The numbers listed are the valuations of Delta at each prime 
               dividing the level, in order.

  analytic_sha -  analytic order of Sha
